RE: Software Graduate Trainee


Dear sir/madam,


After learning of the Software Graduate Trainee opening with Ontum Education Private Limited, I am attaching my resume in consideration for this role. I graduated from CMR Institute of Technology with a B.E in Mechanical Engineering. I have researched and learned a great deal about your organisation's mission and I am confident that my background and attributes will bring further support of your company's values.

Being highly attentive to detail, passionate about applying engineering thoughts in any field, I strive for accuracy and consistency in my daily individual performance, team contributions, and task completion. Further, I offer communication, time-management and scheduling flexibility. I aim to contribute dedication   and hard work to support continuous improvement.

I look forward to speaking with you about my academic and professional background. I am certain that my leadership and problem-solving strengths will bring an invaluable new facet to your existing team. I would like to schedule an interview to learn additional details of the position and explore the contributions I can bring to positively impact your organisation's success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,
MITHILESH HUBLI
