**Final Year Project**  
***Objective***:
We targeted to develop a cost effective nano composite based catalytic converter for exhaust of automobiles which is aimed to reduce NOx (Nitrogen Oxide) emission there by contributing to increase in environmental health.  

As a team member, my contribution was remarkable which included synthesis of the catalyst, filtration of the catalyst, heat treatment process, grinding the sample for X-Ray diffraction process, calculation of grain size of the catalyst using Origin software, development of the catalytic convertor for the purpose of testing and finally writing the research paper for the same. Thus was appreciated by the professors in the colleges.
***Result***:  
External‌ ‌exhaust‌ ‌filter‌ ‌built‌ ‌was‌ ‌tested‌ ‌and‌ ‌found‌ ‌that‌ 50%‌ ‌NOx‌ ‌gas‌ ‌reduction‌ took‌ ‌place‌ ‌from‌ ‌the‌ ‌exhaust‌ ‌of‌ ‌automobiles.‌  

*Skills* :The project helped me to gain an in-depth knowledge in Nano-materials, various softwares and also achieve good results.

**Work Experience**  
***Previous Employer***	: LTIMindtree, Bengaluru  
***Designation***			: Data Engineer  
***Duration***			: Dec 2021 – currently working  
***Projects***:
BO Migration Project
Worked for a Banking domain project. The project was for a period of 2 years and it was a BO – BI Migration Project(SAP to Tableau). 

As in the first year of the project I was working for the ETL team and our aim was to migrated all the data from RDBMS(Oracle) to Datawarehouse using HIVE. I created pipelines using the web application c3po Designer tool and using the Hive platform we used to test our pipelines. I also worked on the web application Autosys which is used to trigger the jobs. Additionally I have a good knowledge in Bitbucket, Teamcity, Udeploy, Tectia, IdeaIntellij. Handled complex views , Stored Procs, Reports and complete end to end ETL process.

In the second phase of the project I worked for the Performance Team where in I had to fine tune queries of the reports which failed in the production environment due to latency. Partially worked on Tableau as well to develop reports. 

In the third phase I worked purely on Complex Report Development using SQL. Since most of the complex reports had cross tables and many variable calculations the reports failed in prod env due to latency as it was a Tableau Tool limitation. Hence as an alternate solution we developed the report with exact data as in BO using SQL queries and implemented Stored Procs on it which was then called in Tableau. 


*Skills* :The project helped me to enhance the proficiency in SQL, Hive, Tableau and ETL concepts I additionally gained softskills and communication knowledge by interacting with the clients.
